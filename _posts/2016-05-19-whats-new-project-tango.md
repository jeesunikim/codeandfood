Project Tango unleashes a new way for you to explore the world. With a few sensors and some computer vision software, your phone gets even smarter, and can start to see the world the way you do. Follow guided arrows to know which exit to take when you get off the subway, see how a sofa looks in your living room before you buy it, or watch zombies battle on your dining table. In this session, we will explore the vision of Project Tango and how it will come to life with the launch of our first consumer phone, announced earlier this year.

## Why, What, Where
- Area Learning (spatial memory)
- Hardware
-- Qualcomm's snapdragon processor
-- Lenovo Tech World 2016 will announce the phone with the correct hardware features
- Software
-- Android N (6-DOF Pose Sensor Type, Depth Camera Type on supported devices)
-- Measurement is pretty cool. You can measure an object or draw lines where you want to measure and it saves in a gallery as a picture and blue print(?). You can measure and drag, let's say draw a square and drag, then it would be a 3d object.
-- you can lay on top of another real objects (lamp on a desk)
-- Gamewise: target practice game. Put on a toy gun and do shooting game (powered by unity)
-- The Museum of Natural History's Dinosaur's exhibition. AR Experience at home. You grab a dinosaur that has and click and hover and when you do that it gives you an information. REAL SIZE DINOSAURS TOO.
- Apps in progress
-- Standard Android development and publishing
-- C/C++, JAva, Unity, Unreal
-- See if the devices are eligible for Tango
- Tango tracking and localization
- Ideas
-- Google Map, showing paths to the destination
