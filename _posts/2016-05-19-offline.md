For most of the web, poor network connectivity destroys the user experience. We can do better. In this session we'll take an online-only site and turn it into a fully network-resilient, offline-first installable progressive web app, and this won't involve rebuilding from scratch; it'll be done in small iterations, with each step improving the user experience whether they're offline, online, or anything in between. This session will cover ServiceWorker, web manifests, add-to-homescreen banners, IndexedDB and BackgroundSync APIs.

Service Workers
- Service Workers in Google Chrome Console
- sw.js does only what you tell him
- driven by events such as fetch.
- Page - Service Worker - Network
-- Service worker plays the middleman

```event.respondWidth()```
-- you can respond it with svg, image, text, etc

## Handling offline
Cache API - unlike a regular browser cache, service workers dump everything into cache. You add offline html and offline css.
- in cache storage session in console you can see your offline cache html and css.

The guardian did - if you have no internet, shows quick crossword instead of 404.
