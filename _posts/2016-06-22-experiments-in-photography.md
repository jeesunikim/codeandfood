Photography become Art
- recognized as fine art in 1950s

Experiment 1:
Not only captures a moment, but represents a period of time
Painter is a computer and a model
Loading pictures, it shows the paint strokes

Experiment 2:
Not only shows artist's emotion, but also picture-taker's personality.
- reminds me of the artist, Degas

Experiment 3:
A new aesthetic
- for instance, Jackson Pollock's "Autumn Rhythm"

Bed, "Bed, a place of conception, birth, sleep, sex, and death"
