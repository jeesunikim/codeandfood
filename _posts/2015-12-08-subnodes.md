<p>What do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_protests" target="_blank">2014 Hong Kong protests</a> and Chile's Constituci√≥n from the 2010 earthquake have in common? Their inability to communicate with others due to its censorship by the government or its natural disaster. Does this mean in places with a lack of internet connectivity, there is no other way to communicate effectively? No - and this is where our project Subnodes comes in.</p>

<p><a href="http://subnodes.org/" target="_blank">Subnodes</a> allows the ubiquitous and affordable Raspberry Pi to work as a wireless access point and enables anyone within range to connect and interact with the software that runs on top of the platform. For the software, we built a CMS application built with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node.</p>

<p>This was our <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/final-projects/subnodes" target="_blank">final project</a> at Fullstack Academy of Code. We submitted this project to Big Apps NYC and made it as a finalist. Before we did our final pitch to the judges, we were able to talk Public Tech Projects Manager from NYC Council who mentioned about the participatory budgeting process and suggested to make an voting/ballot app built on top of Subnodes. That's where our app SuperMesh comes in.</p>

<p>I handled the majority of the software part of Supermesh - the project's configuration (gulp). For Angular's design pattern, we used <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide" target="_blank">John Papa's Angular Styleguide</a>. For a quick prototype, we used Firebase. This project was full of using new technologies.</p>

<p>There were many hiccups - but my favorite hiccup moment is when, one day, all of the sudden, our subnodes stopped working. It was a bizzare moment because we didn't touch anything and it stopped working..... The problem: The Node's update. <a href="https://github.com/youmustfight/subnodes/blob/master/install.sh" target="_blank">Subnodes' shell script</a> required the latest node version and Node's new release broke the project. Our team member quickly switched <a href="https://github.com/youmustfight/subnodes/commit/a7994a7b76a5f2d32ec28e8afc5291ce7a670d5f" target="_blank">the script</a> to.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
	+wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_archive_armhf.deb
	-cd /usr/local		 +sudo dpkg -i node_archive_armhf.deb
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And it worked.</p>
