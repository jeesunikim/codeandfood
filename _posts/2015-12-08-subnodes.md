<p>What do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_protests" target="_blank">2014 Hong Kong protests</a> and Chile's Constituci√≥n from the 2010 earthquake have in common? Their inability to communicate with others due to its censorship by the government or its natural disaster. Does this mean in places with a lack of internet connectivity, there is no other way to communicate effectively? No - and this is where our project Subnodes comes in.</p>

<p><a href="http://subnodes.org/" target="_blank">Subnodes</a> allows the ubiquitous and affordable Raspberry Pi to work as a wireless access point and enables anyone within range to connect and interact with the software that runs on top of the platform. For the software, we built a CMS application built with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node.</p>

<p>This was our <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/final-projects/subnodes" target="_blank">final project</a> at Fullstack Academy of Code. We submitted this project to Big Apps NYC and made it as a finalist.</p>

<p>I handled the majority of developing Supermesh, the software portion of the project, and the project's configuration (gulp). For Angular we chose to follow a design pattern, we used <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide" target="_blank">John Papa's Angular Styleguide</a>. For a quick prototype, we used Firebase.</p>

<p>There were a few hiccups - but the one that sticks with me is when, one day all of the sudden, our meshed network of Rasberry Pis stopped working. It was a bizzare moment because we didn't change anything in the project and the whole thing just stopped working... The problem: Our install script was pulling a package of the latest NodeJS release. The install <a href="https://github.com/youmustfight/subnodes/blob/master/install.sh" target="_blank"> shell script</a> had been installing different releases of NodeJS on our Rasberry Pis as we added them to the mesh. Eventually this broke the project.</p>

<p>Our team member quickly updated the script to be locked to a singe release. We updated the devices that had the newer versions, and it worked.</p>
