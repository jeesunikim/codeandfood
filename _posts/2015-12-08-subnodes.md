<p>What do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_protests" target="_blank">2014 Hong Kong protests</a> and Chile's Constituci√≥n from the 2010 earthquake have in common? Their inability to communicate with others due to its censorship by the government or its natural disaster. Does this mean in places with a lack of internet connectivity, there is no other way to communicate effectively? No - and this is where our project Subnodes comes in.</p>

<p><a href="http://subnodes.org/" target="_blank">Subnodes</a> allows the ubiquitous and affordable Raspberry Pi to work as a wireless access point and enables anyone within range to connect and interact with the software that runs on top of the platform. For the software, we built a CMS application built with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node.</p>

<p>With our graphical interface for changing network settings, we also give power to let device owners turn their Raspberry Pis into a mesh-network nodes. Without technical knowledge, communities can link their Raspberry Pis, allowing apps to reach a much wider audience for scenarios ranging from disasters to protests</p>

<p>This was our <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/final-projects/subnodes" target="_blank">final project</a> at Fullstack Academy of Code. We submitted this project to Big Apps NYC and made it to finalist. Before we did our final pitch to the judges, we were able to talk Public Tech Projects Manager from NYC Council who mentioned about the participatory budgeting process and suggested to make an voting/ballot app for that. That's where our app SuperMesh comes in.</p>

<p>I handled mostly on the software part - the project's configuration (gulp), angular design pattern part, we used <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide" target="_blank">John Papa's Angular Styleguide</a>. For a quick prototype, we used Firebase. We were amazed by its ease of use.</p>

<p>This project invovled using a lot of new technologies that we didn't think weren't such a good idea at that time due to its time restraint, but glad that we did. It was a lot of fun.</p>

<p>There were many hiccups - but my favorite hiccup moment is one day, all of the sudden, our subnodes stopped working. Our team members, Mark and Alex, who worked heavily on raspberry pi and shell commands. We coudln't figure it out for few days and one day, they figured out that it was due to Node's version update. <a href="https://github.com/youmustfight/subnodes/blob/master/install.sh" target="_blank">Subnodes' shell script</a> required the latest node version and its new release broke the project. Our team member quickly switched <a href="https://github.com/youmustfight/subnodes/commit/a7994a7b76a5f2d32ec28e8afc5291ce7a670d5f" target="_blank">the script</a> to.</p>

<p>Awesome work</p>
