<p>This is my first MEAN stack application I built completely on my own. Whenever I was asked, "what app do you want to build?" as a student at Fullstack Academy of Code. I had no app on my mind simply because in this world, there is an app for everything. If I think of one, 99% chance that someone else had already built it.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>No one has built a seating chart app for the Barbarian Group.</p>

<p>The Barbarian Group's <a href="http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/detail/innovative-detail-the-superdesk-at-the-barbarian-group-office_o" target="_blank">Superdesk</a> is well-know in the agency and architecture world. Its concept is that everyone sits at this one huge desk. My initial reaction to this desk is 'this must be the biggest desk in the world'.</p>
