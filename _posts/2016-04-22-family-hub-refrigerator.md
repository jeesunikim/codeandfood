<p>Family Hub Refrigerator is my favorite project of all time. It required more functionalities than usual and I was able to use Greensock for the first time on a client project. Initially, it had more animations that what it has on production at the moment.</p>

<p>As a first project, there were mistakes made. The code that I wrote certainly lacks structure. Since this project, I have learned that my codes need to be more object oriented. Often with a tight deadline, I often forgot to follow the best practice of writing the code. This code has gone through one refactoring, but it needs more refactoring.</p>
