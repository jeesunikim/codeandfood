<p>RBG for Good is a mobile WebAR experience that lets you have Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Samsung Upgrade Program is a static landing page that is written in HTML and SCSS. It has bootstrap's <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/collapse/" target="_blank">Collapse</a> component for the FAQs module. It wasn't difficult to build. The difficulty was introduced when the client asked us to remove tagging in the expanded state.</p> 

<p>This is a simple task - but I kept getting a conflict when I edited bootstrap's code. I thought of removing the bootstrap javascript and start building my own collapse javascript function from scratch. Given the deadline, I kept the bootstrap and tested each function in Bootstrap's collapse component until I ended up with a result the client was happy with.</p>

<p>I used to think that Bootstrap was a hindrance to learning because it makes everything so easy. But going through its code line by line, I appreciated its structure and learned how to use OOP better.</p>
