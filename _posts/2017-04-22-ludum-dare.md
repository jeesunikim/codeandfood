<p>On the weekend of April 21st, 10 Firstborners (designers, 3D technical artists, strategist, developers, and producer) created a game for the 38th Ludum Dare event, "one of the world's largest and longest running Game Jam events." We created everything from scratch within 72 hours &ndash; ideation, art, animations, dialog, sound, and code. It is called Supermarket Sneak. You can find more details <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/$16802" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The theme for Ludum Dare 38 was <strong>"A Small World"</strong>. Our strategist came up with the idea of a survival game where a player has to traverse the aisles of Smalltown Grocery, "avoiding the talkative townies, and grabbing each item on Momâ€™s shopping list before your phone runs out of battery-life." It was a fun project because we did everything together from scratch.</p>

<p>From using sprites to create moving characters to creating collision in Phaser, it was pretty mind-blowing to see how much efforts it takes to create a game! Many thanks to the colleagues who asked me to work on this project together. It was so fun!</p>
