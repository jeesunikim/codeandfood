The rules of the games.

Making money on apps is harder than games.
- b/c its generally more accepted.- games monetization mechanics are more flexible.
- in game purchasable content is almost infinite

Freeminum is the dominant model.
Apps and Games face increasing competition for UA.
CPI should always be lower than LTV (LTV = f(Retention, Engagement, Monetization)).
As a result the average CPI is rising.
- retention and engagement drive conversion.

Retention is King.

Game developers optimize for retention before investing in user acquisition
- tracking how this retention works and change game to increase this retention.
- this process is rigorous
- lots of games get killed during this process

Firebase Analytics offers
- Renetion
-- how retention changes each week
- Funnel report (where the user gets stuck)
- Audiences in Firebase Analytics
-- Target with Remote Config: ex. subscription - high single spend point but not very frequent - comfortable spending a lot, but don't like to be bothered - provides different offer.


Rule 1. Focus on the engagement cliff
- Days 1-7 are most critical
- biggest drop happens in the first 7 days.
- after that all curves tend to be flattened.
- 1. News and Magazine 2. Commmunications 3. Social 4. Tools 5. Health and Fitness are the top Day 7 Retention for Top 100 aps by category.


Pixelberry - games spend a lot of time on tutorials.

Progresion (very specific to game)
 - playdots looked at each level and measured Lapse rate and Revenue per Player.
 - Keep the difficulty below the red line Two Dots obtained better retention and ARPPU.

 Rule 1. Climb the engagement cliff
 - find features that create value without much engagement from the user
 - Define activation (key action) moments that are gradually more invested.
 - Treat authentication as a service not a task. 

OkCupid is an example.
- Redesigned, and got 21% higher retention
- User Experience counts

Freeletics is also an example.
- Give personalised attainable goals to users
- give a change to the user to master the first experience
- Gained 47% D1 retention
- Fitness app

Rule 2. Embraze your app's multiple personality disorder (given that the user keeeps using it)
- Not every install is made equal
-- no matter how successful the game is, people will not spend a dime on it. And those who spend pay very little. What each user is going to spend - the value perception they have. 
- Different offers that developer triggers.
Early Spender (Upsell) -> Mid Spender (Discounted Upsell) -> Late Spencer (Heavily Discounted Upsell)
- Always realize that users have a different value perception and inclination to purchase

Space Ape predicts the future
- User segmentation based on predictive LTV and spend pattern calculated onfirst 7 days behavior
- Targets different segments with customized offers.
- up to 2x better conversion
- track player's behavior

Example. Wish selects offeres based on user engagement. Low engagement users see less expensive products. Engaged users see more and expensive products.

Rule 3. Sell umbrellas where it rains
- Playdots is making it relevant
- Make purchasing accessible easily from within the app and minimize taps especially where your IAP products are.

Example. Tom Tom
- From premium to freemium..
- Free kms countdown always present provide a sense of urgency.
- Upgrade always one tap away.
- Careful call to actions - screen recommending to upgrade, triggered when most relevant.

Example. Busuu (language app)
- placing the paywall where it matters. Content wall over premium content once the user reaches it in their flow (+30% Conversion).
- Content wall on adding more languages (+83% Conversion)
