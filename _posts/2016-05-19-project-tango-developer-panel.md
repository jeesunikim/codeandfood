Project Tango Developer Panel

Ever dreamed your app could let users play dominos without having to pick up the pieces, or redesign a kitchen without heavy lifting? Project Tango is a set of spatial sensors that allows your device to see the world like you do, giving you a new, interactive way to play games, reimagine spaces, and more. Developers from Lowe's, Autodesk, Schell Games and Funomena will talk about their experiences building on Project Tango, from tips on how to get started to thoughts on how Project Tango will change the way we play, work and live.

Project Tango understands space and motion. Kellee Santiago.

Panels:
Joel Pennington - Autodesk, product manager. take technlogy from the game film and tv and hand it to autodesk - amazing film productions such as avatar and put it in tablet that 

Robin Hunicke - Funomena
Intersection b/w new technology and game development.

Kyle Nel
- Lowe's Innovation Labs. Persistent Customer problem - home remodel for instance, not the ability to buy, it's visualization, trying to understand how things happen around your house, try to understand what it would look like (reminds me of what CenterStage tried to solve). Project Tango will be able to solve that problem.

Jesse Schell
- Schell Games.
- drawn to Tango, interactive theme park, mix digital with space.

## Challenges for Project Tango 
Robin Hunicke:
- VR involves two things: body and our perception of reality.
- Augmented reality, you have to work all sides of the world. Building something that has a real aesthetic like feeling. How do we build consistent , aesthetic experience. You don't need to design everything. 

Joel Pennington:
- Get designers on Tablet: 

Kyle Nel:
- low cognitive vs. high cognitive
- Intuitive piece.

Jessee:
- Shift to how to make tango experience = mouse-based game play to touch game base.
- Watch how children do, give kids tango
- Learning vs. Unlearging.

## Resources that helped bringing Augmented realities
Robin: Looking at works of disney. park design and experience design and physical design. The problem is to have people move while using tango. What draws people's attention? 

Joel: Impressed with APIs and the Docs.
- Blue prints were the best (Architects use it)

Kyle: Solving human problems and human needs - professional science fiction writers. Their original stories look a lot like Tango/VR. 

Jesse: realm of special design. look at real world - how, why? Spatial context - sitting, standing, moving.

## Future of Tango
Jesse: Project Tango is learning alphabet of augment realities. App/Game. Apps generally are about creating something useful. Games are doing something fun. Middle space - app creating something fun. Tango is the middle space.

Kyle: 

Robin: 

Joel: Hard to make compelling content. Take assets that were created traditionally and get them into that interactive experience to elicit feedback.

## For first time tango developers
Jesse: 
- keep it simple

Robin: Try most bizzarre
