Project Tango Developer Panel

Ever dreamed your app could let users play dominos without having to pick up the pieces, or redesign a kitchen without heavy lifting? Project Tango is a set of spatial sensors that allows your device to see the world like you do, giving you a new, interactive way to play games, reimagine spaces, and more. Developers from Lowe's, Autodesk, Schell Games and Funomena will talk about their experiences building on Project Tango, from tips on how to get started to thoughts on how Project Tango will change the way we play, work and live.

Project Tango understands space and motion. Kellee Santiago.

Panels:
Joel Pennington - Autodesk, product manager. take technlogy from the game film and tv and hand it to autodesk - amazing film productions such as avatar and put it in tablet that 

Robin Hunicke - Funomena
Intersection b/w new technology and game development.

Kyle Nel
- Lowe's Innovation Labs. Persistent Customer problem - home remodel for instance, not the ability to buy, it's visualization, trying to understand how things happen around your house, try to understand what it would look like (reminds me of what CenterStage tried to solve). Project Tango will be able to solve that problem.

Jesse Schell
- Schell Games.
- drawn to Tango, interactive theme park, mix digital with space.

## Challenges for Project Tango 
Robin Hunicke:
- VR involves two things: body and our perception of reality.
- Augmented reality, you have to work all sides of the world. Building something that has a real aesthetic like feeling. How do we build consistent , aesthetic experience. You don't need to design everything. 

Joel Pennington:
- Get designers on Tablet: 

Kyle Nel:
- low cognitive vs. high cognitive
- Intuitive piece.

Jessee:
- Shift to how to make tango experience = mouse-based game play to touch game base.
- Watch how children do, give kids tango
- Learning vs. Unlearging.

## Resources that helped bringing Augmented realities
Robin: Looking at works of disney. park design and experience design and physical design. The problem is to have people move while using tango. What draws people's attention? 

Joel: Impressed with APIs and the Docs.
- Blue prints were the best (Architects use it)

Kyle: Solving human problems and human needs - professional science fiction writers. Their original stories look a lot like Tango/VR. 

Jesse: realm of special design. look at real world - how, why? Spatial context - sitting, standing, moving.

## Future of Tango
Jesse: Project Tango is learning alphabet of augment realities. App/Game. Apps generally are about creating something useful. Games are doing something fun. Middle space - app creating something fun. Tango is the middle space.

Kyle: 

Robin: 

Joel: Hard to make compelling content. Take assets that were created traditionally and get them into that interactive experience to elicit feedback.

## For first time tango developers
Jesse: 
- keep it simple

Robin: Try most bizzarre

## What's New with Project Tango (different talk from the develoepr panel)
Project Tango unleashes a new way for you to explore the world. With a few sensors and some computer vision software, your phone gets even smarter, and can start to see the world the way you do. Follow guided arrows to know which exit to take when you get off the subway, see how a sofa looks in your living room before you buy it, or watch zombies battle on your dining table. In this session, we will explore the vision of Project Tango and how it will come to life with the launch of our first consumer phone, announced earlier this year.

## Why, What, Where
- Area Learning (spatial memory)
- Hardware
-- Qualcomm's snapdragon processor
-- Lenovo Tech World 2016 will announce the phone with the correct hardware features
- Software
-- Android N (6-DOF Pose Sensor Type, Depth Camera Type on supported devices)
-- Measurement is pretty cool. You can measure an object or draw lines where you want to measure and it saves in a gallery as a picture and blue print(?). You can measure and drag, let's say draw a square and drag, then it would be a 3d object.
-- you can lay on top of another real objects (lamp on a desk)
-- Gamewise: target practice game. Put on a toy gun and do shooting game (powered by unity)
-- The Museum of Natural History's Dinosaur's exhibition. AR Experience at home. You grab a dinosaur that has and click and hover and when you do that it gives you an information. REAL SIZE DINOSAURS TOO.
- Apps in progress
-- Standard Android development and publishing
-- C/C++, JAva, Unity, Unreal
-- See if the devices are eligible for Tango
- Tango tracking and localization
- Ideas
-- Google Map, showing paths to the destination
