The recent progress of machine learning is impressive, and the applications seem endless. Neural networks are incredible tools allowing us not just to analyze but also manipulate and generate images, movies and music. Over the last 18 months, the Lab at the Cultural Institute has invited artists and creative technologists to explore ways to apply machine learning to culture and the arts. We'll present some of our results with some onstage technical demos and a few special guests.

-cWhat do humans find interesting? What makes one image more artful than another one?

The Mechanical Curator

He started collecting similiar images - for instance, stone cutter or 16 very sad girls. Classical machine learning

Inside Deep Dream - Based on machine learning.

- you put in an image and you have no idea what you would get.

Lucid Dreaming (3 simple steps to enhance your dreams)
- Improvement #1: Desaturation
BVLC GoogLeNet Architecture
When you put an image, it stops at certain neuron - then emphasize those characteristics
- Improvement #2: Category Suppression
Reminds me of ito junji

MNIST with twist
- Train a machine to recognize alphabets.
- He had to manually grab the letters and put them in a folder by the letter (manual categories)
- Left swipe, right swipe to confirm whether the machine is doing wront or right.

Cyril Diagne - Digital Interaction Artist
How does machine learning categorize calm? It shows peaceful landcape. Also 'lady in waiting' or 'bling bling'.
