# codeandfood.com

This is my personal [blog](https://www.codeandfood.com) where I'll be sharing projects, codes, and recipes. Using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a blog platform was inspired by [Dan Eden](https://github.com/daneden/daneden.me/).

I have a separate branch for [gatsby blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which is work in progress.

## Who This Repo is For

This repo has grown a lot since I first created in 2016. I had some real bad codes in here and I'm sure my future self would look at my current code and say 'wow, I have grown a lot.' This repo is mostly for me to see my progress as a coder. Beyond that, if someone finds this repo helpful in some way, that would be super cool too :blush:.
