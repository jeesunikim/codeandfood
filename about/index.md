				<h2>"I'm a developer based in New York City, currently working at <a href="https://barbariangroup.com/" target="_blank">the Barbarian Group</a>"</h2>
				<p>Born in Seoul, South Korea - my journey in the United States has been an unique one and yet, I am proud of my 14 year old self to trust her guts and came to this country by herself.
				</p>
				<p>I have stepped through an unconventional background to become a developer. Coming from design background - once it was my insecurity in this software industry field and now, that background has become my unique asset.</p>
				<p>In April of 2015, I enrolled in Fullstack Academy of Code, a part time 6 months long fullstack JavaScript coding bootcamp based in New York City while I was a full time developer at the Barbarian Group.</p>
				<p>Before my role at the Barbarian Group, I was a developer intern at Crispin Porter + Bogusky.</p>
