				<h2>"I'm Jee(sun), a developer based in New York City, currently working at <a href="https://barbariangroup.com/" target="_blank">the Barbarian Group</a>"</h2>
				<p>The idea for CODE &amp;&amp; FOOD originated while I was searching for a new domain to host my blog. I wanted my new domain to include 'code' since it is the main topic of this blog, but also wanted to include something unrelated to code that also represents me. My love of food and cooking came to mind as I remembered something Fullstack Academy of Code's founder, David Yang had said. I cannot find his quote, but he described JavaScript function invocation as the function itself being its recipe and its invocation is like doing the cooking that brings the result of the finished meal.</p>
				<p>The more I think about it, code and food share a lot of similarities. One I can think of is that its barrier to entry is easy. Also, people often start learning how to code or cook by copying what others are doing.</p>
				<p>But continuing down the path is more difficult. For both, the challenge comes when the 'recipe' is removed from the process. When I began writing HTML without the 'recipe', I commonly made the mistake of typing 'link src' instead of 'link href' in the head element. And when I began cooking without a recipe, it took a few times before I gained a feel for using heat effectively to cook to my ingredients to the desired result.</p>
				<p>I started this blog to showcase my experiments on coding and cooking - relying less on other people's recipes and more on my own creativity.</p>
				<p>But most of all, I hope that this blog helps someone in some way.</p>
