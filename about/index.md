				<h2>"I'm Jee(sun), a developer based in New York City, currently working at <a href="https://barbariangroup.com/" target="_blank">the Barbarian Group</a>"</h2>
				<p>I came up with CODE &amp;&amp; FOOD while I was searching for a new domain to buy. I wanted my new domain to include the word, 'code', but also wanted to include something unrelated to code. I thought of Fullstack Academy of Code's founder, David Yang's quote on JavaScript Function Invocation - that function itself is like a recipe and its invocation is like an actual cooking that brings a result.</p>
				<p>Code and food share a lot of similarities. One I can think of is that its barrier to entry is easy. People often start learning how to code or cook by copying what others are doing.</p>
				<p>But its path isn't an easy one. Its difficulty comes in when its 'recipe' is removed from the process. When I began my HTML practice without the 'recipe', how often I made a mistake by typing 'link src' instead of 'link href' in the header. In cooking, I often made a mistake of both heating the meat and chopping the ingrendients at the same time, which often caused the meat to burn.</p>
				<p>I started this blog to showcase my experiments on coding and cooking - relying less on other people's creation and relying more on my own creativity.</p>
				<p>But most of all, I hope that - to some people - my blog is the reason how they started to code or(and) cook.</p>
